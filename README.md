ðŸ“œ ScheduleMixer
A tool to mix ingredients and simulate effect chains for Schedule 1



ðŸš€ Features
Real-time effect simulation based on active traits

Accurate chaining (only unlocks effects if conditions are truly met)

Optimized pathfinding to achieve desired effects

Standalone executable available (no Python install required)



ðŸ›  How to Run
If you have Python 3.12+ installed:

```bash
python ScheduleMixer.py
```

If you prefer the standalone .exe:

Download ScheduleMixer.exe from the Releases page (or from this repo if included).

Double-click to run.



ðŸŽ¯ How it Works
Start by selecting a base product (e.g., "OG Kush", "Green Crack").

Choose one or more desired effects you want to achieve.

The program will calculate and display the correct ingredient mixing order.

Fully simulates effect replacements to avoid false positives.
